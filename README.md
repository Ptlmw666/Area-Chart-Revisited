This project uses Vue 3 and TypeScript for the frontend and Python for the backend.

After setting up the environment and running the project, you will see two buttons on the web: EXPERIMENT 1 and EXPERIMENT 2. You can click on either button to access the experiment content.
If you prefer not to run the project locally, you can access our experiment system directly via this link: http://8.134.215.31:9999/start. The experiment content is the same as running the project locally.

**Please make sure to click the "RESET ALL" button before starting any experiments. This step is crucial!!!**
